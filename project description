Apply a SVM to classify hand-written digits by using the package e1071. 
Each data point is a 256-vector as a 16-by-16 image of a hand-written 
number which can be classified as either 5 or 6. First, I applied cross-
validations on parameters of both the linear SVM with soft margin and 
the SVM with both soft margin and RBF kernel. Based on data-visualizations 
(ggplot2) of CV estimates of the misclassification rate, I selected a 
model for each classifier, and then trained them on the test dataset 
for further model selection.
